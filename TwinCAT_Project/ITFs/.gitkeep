# Interfaces (ITFs)

This directory contains interface definitions for object-oriented programming in TwinCAT.

## Naming Conventions

- Interfaces: `I_` prefix (e.g., `I_Motor`, `I_Sensor`)

## Best Practices

- Use interfaces to define contracts between components
- Keep interfaces focused on a single responsibility
- Document interface methods clearly
- Use interfaces for dependency injection and testability
- Consider interface segregation principle
